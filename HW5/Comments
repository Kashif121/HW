            This program intends to calculate the distance traveled per hour of travel using various 
forms of transportations. The most important formula in this program is the distance= speed multiplied
by time. Each of these calculations will be printed to an output text file named by the specific vehicle used. 
As an example for the Car calculations, the output was printed to Car.txt.  The purpose of the main method is to unite all 
of other methods in the program and act as meeting ground for all of them.Standard variables are declared such as one for 
the vehicle, speed, time, and distance. Then we will utlize the while(sc.hasNext) to read in from an input file that has 6 
types of vehicles, with a speed and time for each. Then in this while loop the saveasFile method is invoked as we will 
need to invoke the distance method within it. The choice to return a String could be deemed peculiar for the distance method, 
however, it allowed the most flexibility and easy in formatting the output how it was intended to be printed. In addition, it 
allowed the program to combine steps and return a statement saying various inputs were invalid, such as if time or speed was negative. 
In this method I declared distance and intialized it to 0, considering we were going to use it in the for loop later on. Then I declared
and initalized four string variables, firstLine, dashedLine, hourToString, and distanceToString to empty string. I assigned the value 
of the title of the data to be the firstLine variable, and then had the dashline be the second line to separate the title and the data 
in the output file. Then the for loop was used so that the distance could be calculated at every hour of the journey based on the speed 
given in the input text file. The method returned the String that encapsulated the title, dashed line, and the data. However, if invalid 
inputs were given, a string that explained that invalid inputs were given, was returned. 
           Lastly in the saveAsFile method, we must declare an object of the PrintStream class, but also we are going to pass through the 
vehicle name for each input from the while loop in the main so that, each vehicle can have their own respective output text file. Following
this we are going to print the data provided in the distance method, so we are going to invoke it within the saveAsFile. Then the next step 
is to finally invoke the saveAsFile method in the main method, where all the requirements of the program will be met. This program compiles 
perfectly and runs well.
